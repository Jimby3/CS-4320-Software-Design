**Steps to run our application:**

1. Pull down the source code from this repository
2. Install python library (python-google-places) if you want to read more: https://github.com/slimkrazy/python-google-places
3. Go to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview and create a google places account so you can get an API key
4. In the file googleApiEngine, replace "PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual API key
5. Run main
6. Voila! Your application should now be up and running.

**Introduction To Application**
- BiteMatch is a food decision tool designed to assist users in overcoming decision paralysis when choosing where to eat. It offers a decision-making process that enables users to select between two restaurant options until they reach their desired choice or receive a random restaurant recommendation based on their preferences.

**Features**
- _Localized Dining:_ Users are presented with restaurant options near their specified location.
- _Decision-Based:_ Users can choose between fast food, sit-down, or custom cuisine options, then engage in a tournament-style decision-making process to select their preferred restaurant.
- _Random-Based:_ Alternatively, users can receive a random restaurant suggestion based on their preferences.

**Technologies**
- _Python:_ Employed as the core programming language for implementing application logic.
- _Git/Github:_ Utilized as the version control system for collaborative development and code management.
- _Google Places API:_ Integrated through the python-google-places library, enabling seamless API calls to retrieve restaurant information based on location.

**Deliverables**
Our final deliverables:

- _Modeling Diagrams:_ Included at least four modeling diagrams (UML activity, sequence, component, and class diagrams) to categorize aspects based on different modeling perspectives.
- _Source Code and Documentation:_ Provided the complete source code alongside comprehensive documentation for the prototype.
- _Final Presentation Slides:_ Presented slides containing detailed information about the project during class presentations.
- _Final Reports:_ Offered reflections on the project and individual contributions.
